#Ideal US state to move to
I am trying to determine what state I should move to based on a few factors.

1. Aggregrated the cost of living, school system rating, crime rate, and healthcare services data for all 50 US states.
2. Cleaned the raw data; this includes removing NAs and irrelevant data and making it into a pandas data frame.
3. Analyzed the cleaned data using pandas, and created data frames of only relevant data.
4. Developed my own ratings for each of these factors using the pandas and the matrix function from sci-kit learn library.
5. These ratings are what were used to determine the ranking of each state in these categories.
